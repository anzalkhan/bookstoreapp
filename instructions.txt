Product Requirements Document: Online
Bookstore with Desktop Application
Version: 1.0
Date: 2024-10-20
1. Introduction
This document outlines the product requirements for a desktop application designed for an online
business to sell and rent books. The system will consist of a backend RESTful API built with Java or
Python Flask and a MySQL database, and a client-facing desktop GUI application built in either Java
or Python.
The primary goal is to provide a seamless experience for customers to discover, purchase, and rent
books, while also giving managers the necessary tools to administer orders and payments.
2. User Roles
There are two primary user roles for this system:
 Customer: A registered user who wants to find and acquire books. They can browse the
catalog, search for specific titles or authors, and place orders to either buy or rent books.
 Manager: An administrative user responsible for business operations. They can log in to a
specialized interface to manage books, view orders and update the payment status of those
orders.
3. Functional Requirements
3.1 User Account Management
ID Requirement Details
FR1.1 User
Registration
A new user must be able to create an account. Required fields:
username, password, and a valid email address. Passwords must be
securely hashed on the backend.
ID Requirement Details
FR1.2 User Login
A registered user must be able to log in using their username and
password. The system must authenticate the user and establish a
session.
FR1.3 Session
Persistence
Once logged in, the user should remain authenticated until they
explicitly log out. All subsequent actions requiring authentication
must be tied to their session.
3.2 Book Catalog and Search
ID Requirement Details
FR2.1 Book Search A logged-in user must be able to search for books. The search
functionality should accept a keyword.
FR2.2 Search by
Title/Author
The search keyword should be matched against both book titles
and author names.
FR2.3 Search Results
Display
The search results should be displayed in a clear list format,
showing at a minimum: Book Title, Author, Price (to buy), and Price
(to rent).
3.3 Ordering and Transactions
ID Requirement Details
FR3.1 Buy a Book A logged-in user must be able to select one or more books from the
search results to purchase.
FR3.2 Rent a Book A logged-in user must be able to select one or more books from the
search results to rent.
FR3.3 Place Order The user can finalize their selection of books to buy and/or rent in a
single transaction, creating an order.
3.4 Billing and Notifications
ID Requirement Details
FR4.1 Bill Generation
Upon placing an order, the system must generate a detailed bill. The
bill should include a unique order ID, list of items (bought/rented),
individual prices, and the total amount due.
FR4.2 Email
Notification
The generated bill must be automatically sent to the user's registered
email address. This requires integration with an email sending service.
3.5 Manager Functions
ID Requirement Details
FR5.1 Manager Login A manager must have a separate, secure login mechanism.
This role should be distinct from a standard customer role.
FR5.2 View Orders A logged-in manager must be able to view a list of all buy and
rental orders in the system.
FR5.3 Update Payment
Status
The manager must be able to select an order and update its
payment status (e.g., from "Pending" to "Paid").
FR5.4 Create and Update
Book Information
The manager must be able to add new books or update their
information (e.g., a book is returned from rental and available
for the next one).
4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Technology Stack
Area Requirement
Backend Java or Python (with the Flask framework).
Database MySQL.
API Design Must follow RESTful principles.
Area Requirement
Frontend A native desktop GUI application developed in either Java (e.g., Swing) or Python
(e.g., Tkinter). Note: This is not a web application.
4.2 Performance
ID Requirement Details
NFR1.1 API Response
Time API endpoints should respond to typical requests in under 500ms.
NFR1.2 GUI
Responsiveness
The desktop client should remain responsive and not freeze during
network operations (e.g., searching for books). Asynchronous calls
to the backend are required.
4.3 Security
ID Requirement Details
NFR2.1 Password
Storage
All user passwords must be stored in the database using a strong,
one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
NFR2.2 API
Authentication
All API endpoints that handle user-specific data or actions (e.g.,
placing an order, searching) must be protected and require a valid
authentication token.
NFR2.3 Authorization Users must only be able to access their own data. Managers must
not be able to perform customer actions and vice-versa.
5. Assumptions and Dependencies
 An external SMTP service or email gateway will be used for sending bill notifications.
Credentials for this service will need to be securely managed.
 The initial population of the book database (titles, authors, prices) is outside the scope of this
document but will be required for testing.
 The application does not need to handle real-time payment processing (e.g., credit card
integration). The manager's function to update payment status is sufficient.
6. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for v1.0)
 User profiles with order history.
 Book reviews and ratings.
 Inventory management for physical books.
 More advanced search filters (e.g., by genre, publication year).
 A system for handling book returns (for rentals).
